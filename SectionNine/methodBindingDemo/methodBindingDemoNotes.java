    // Binding a method call to -
    // 1. method declaration and its implementation
    // method declaration ~ method signature
    // method implementation ~ method body

    // Method Signature Binding

    // 1. Compiler checks if reference type has compatible method

    // 2. Writes method signature into bytecode

    // 3. Applies to both static and instance methods

    // Method Implementation Binding
    // 1. Static Method ~ by comiler based on reference type
    // 2. Instance method ~ by JVM based on object type.
    // Instances fields are early binded
