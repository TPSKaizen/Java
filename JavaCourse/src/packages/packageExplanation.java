	 * A package is a grouping of related types providing
	 * access protection and name space management.
	 * 
	 * Note that types refers to classes, interfaces, 
	 * enumerations, and annotation types.
	 * 
	 * Enumerations and annotation types are special kinds
	 * of classes and interfaces, respectively, so types are
	 * often referred to in this lesson simply as classes and 
	 * interfaces
	 * 
	 * Naming convention :
	 * hyphenated-name.example.org :  org.example.hyphenated_name
	 * example.int :  int_.example
	 * 123name.example.com	:  com.example._123name
