		 * Used for key value arrangements. 
		 * Can have duplicates, but keys are unique
		 * Uses set for store keys, uses list for values
		 * E.g Having employee keys to access employee name
		 * HashMap, treemap are not thread safe
		 * Treemap sort is only applicable to the keys
		 * HashMap access elements in random order
		 * Hashtable is thread safe but slower
		 * LinkedHashMap carries two properties:
		 * 1. Property of hashmap where elements are stored/displayed in random order
		 * 2. Linked property of LinkedList where sequence is maintained
		 * So we can get the insertion order
