	/*
	 * The need for comparable comes from sorting collections
	 * 
	 * Java normally sorts via natural sorting order via Collection.sort();
	 *  This holds true for built in datatypes but not for custom
	 *  
	 *  E.g a List of type Student.
	 *  
	 *  We need to implement our own sorting code for that.
	 *  
	 *  Comparable is an interface 
	 *  
	 *  public interface Comparable<T> {
	 *  	public int compareTo(T o);
	 *  		//T = foreign obj
	 *  		// o = current obj
	 *  }
	 *
