     * It was a pain to update public APIs which used interfaces because when a new
     * method was added it usually would break the previous version
     * 
     * Default methods were added to circumvent this and allow for interface
     * evolution with binary compatibilty (binary compatibility = recompilation of
     * implementation code not required)
     * 
     * Interfaces can have a default implementation
